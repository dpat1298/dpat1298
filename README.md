I am PLC/SCADA Programmer with a passion . I have been programming PLCs for 5 years and SCADA systems for 2. I have worked mostly in the water/wastewater and robotics industries on both the design and commissioning side as well as the maintenance side.

## Objective

After being exposed to what Operational Technology (OT) is I have developed a passion to learn OT networking and security principles. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance on my personal time, and through my employer taking professional development opportunities to learn OT principles. My goal is to develop into an OT security professional.
